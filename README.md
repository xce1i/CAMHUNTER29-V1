## Overview

CAMHUNTER29 performs automated scanning, detection, and reporting of network camera endpoints.  
The tool generates structured reports and provides technical insights into discovered devices for security assessment purposes.

## Features

- Network camera discovery and enumeration
- Detection of accessible stream endpoints (RTSP/HTTP)
- Vulnerability indication based on exposure patterns
- Automated HTML report generation
- Structured logging and scan statistics
- Modular architecture for future extensions

## Architecture

The tool operates in multiple phases:

1. Target discovery
2. Endpoint enumeration
3. Stream analysis
4. Report generation

Each phase is designed to ensure clarity, accuracy, and reproducibility of scan results.

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xce1i/CAMHUNTER29-V1/
chmod +x camhunter.sh
